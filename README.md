This is an executable version of Minesweeper written in Python.
I made this over the course of a couple of weeks in February 2022.

The program can be run from the command line (using python minesweeper.py) or by clicking on the executable in the "executable" folder.

This script uses the libraries PyGame and TKinter to handle the user-interface.

All of the code is in one script: "minesweeper.py". I have since learned that it's better practice to separate Python code into modules in order to make the code more modular.
